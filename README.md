# Tachometer-with-PIC16F877A

This project implements a **tachometer** system using the **PIC16F877A microcontroller** to measure and monitor the RPM (revolutions per minute) of a DC motor with high accuracy. The RPM is displayed on a 16x2 LCD and transmitted via **UART protocol** to an Android application built using **MIT App Inventor**.

In addition to real-time monitoring, users can remotely:
- **Start/stop the motor**
- **Control its speed** via PWM using either a physical **potentiometer** or the mobile application.

> üìå **Accuracy:** The system provides highly reliable readings with a typical error margin of less than ¬±3 RPM, ensuring stable and consistent measurements.

### üì≤ App Usage & Features

The mobile app offers a user-friendly interface to monitor and control the motor in real-time via Bluetooth. Below is a breakdown of its setup, interface, and capabilities:

#### üîß Initial Setup

1. **Enable Bluetooth** on your Android device.
2. Pair it with your Bluetooth module (usually named `HC-05`).
   - Default PIN: `1234` or `0000`
3. Open the app and tap **"Available devices"**.
4. A new screen will appear showing all paired devices. Select your module to establish a connection.

> üí° **Tip:**  
> You can rename your Bluetooth module or change its password using **AT Commands** in AT mode via an Arduino.  
> [üîó Learn how to enter AT mode and send commands](https://www.martyncurrey.com/arduino-with-hc-05-bluetooth-module-at-mode/)

#### üéõÔ∏è App Interface Overview

- **Live Data Display**
  - RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)
  - Total Revolutions
  - PWM Duty Cycle (%)

- **Motor Control**
  - Power button (ON/OFF)
  - Mode switch to toggle between:
    - Physical control using a potentiometer
    - App-based PWM control
  - Two buttons to increase (+) or decrease (‚àí) motor speed

- **Data Tools**
  - **Reset Counter**: Resets the revolutions counter, useful for fresh testing intervals.
  - **Lap Button**: Captures the current RPM and revolution values at a specific time.  
    You can use this to compare RPM after a certain duration (e.g., 1 minute).

### ‚≠ê App Highlights

- üîå **Wireless Control**: Start, stop, and adjust speed remotely via Bluetooth
- üîÑ **Dual PWM Control Modes**: Choose between physical and app-based control
- üìä **Real-Time Monitoring**: Accurate and stable display of motor RPM and revolutions
- üß™ **Performance Testing Tools**: Revolution reset and lap logging features for data analysis

## üß† How It Works

The system uses an IR encoder sensor to count how many solid segments of the encoder disk pass in a time period **T**, then applies the following formula:

RPM = (Number of pulses detected in T / T) √ó (60 / N)

Where:
- `T` = measurement window in seconds
- `N` = number of solid segments on the encoder disk (in this case: 20)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes for Replication

- Make sure to add a **voltage divider** (using 1.8K and 1.3K resistors) on the RX pin of the Bluetooth module to avoid damaging it.
- It is recommended to install a **heatsink** on the 7805 voltage regulator.
- Ensure **proper capacitor values** are used around the regulator for power stability.
- Double-check the orientation of all polarized components (diodes, electrolytic capacitors, etc.)
